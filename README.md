This is one of the projects I am currently working on as an R&D Engineer for a manufacturing company. 
The robotic arm is called a loader. It simply pushes packaged products into cardboard cases. 
The Python program was developed to track the arm's motion. The code was handy for other controls and electrical engineers in the department to better understand the loader's position.
